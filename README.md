# Graduate Student Admission Prediction

This is an Exploratory Data analysis of how different factors tend to influence the Chance of Admit for a Masters Student. Factors here being GRE Scores, TOEFL Scores, LOR, SOP, Research Experience & CGPA. We go through every factor in detail and build a Multi Linear Regression Model to better predict the **Chance of Admit**.

This work is inspired by [Yocket](http://yocket.com/blog/yocket-admit-predictor-5471)! An app which provides the University admits based on their Educational & test scores.
